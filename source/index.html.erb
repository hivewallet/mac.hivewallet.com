<h2>Hive for other platforms</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a mobile wallet for iOS or Android, check out <a href="https://hivewallet.com">Hive Web</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> at the moment Hive Mac is not compatible with the Hive Web wallets, so you can't access your Hive Mac wallet in Hive iOS and vice versa, you need to create two separate wallets. This will change in a future version.</p>
